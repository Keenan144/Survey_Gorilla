--HIGH LEVEL CONCEPT
Website where new boots can login, rate their knowledge/skill level on various technical/social topics, and then login again at the end of DBC for comparison. Advice for new/future/prospective boots, feedback for DBC, and job placement may also be incorporated. Periodic email reminders for updates

--P1
Website where boots can "log in", identify/select skills, rate them every phase, provide advice. Public facing website to view progress over time and advice to other/prospective boots/

--P2
Add on email reminders, hopefully tap into DBC API. Overhaul with Javascript?

--P3
Polish, add on additional features?



--MVP

Blocked from logging in/selecting/editing other's accounts/info
